# Global Search [NUGS]
A university managed micro-service and script library to allow members of the university community to embed search into their websites.  This search allows for local site and entire university level searches.

## Configuration
This micro-service utilizes the Google Custom Search Engine.  We are using a pay-for plan that is available for the entire university to leverage.

### search.northeastern.edu
This is a simple use interface to run a global university search.  Results are returned directly in this page and no configuration is necessary.  This page is built using the same scripts as one that is called from a remote website.
