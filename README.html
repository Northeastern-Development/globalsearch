<h1 id="nugs">Global Search </h1>

<p>A university managed micro-service and script library to allow members of the university community to embed search into their websites. This search allows for local site and entire university level searches.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p>This micro-service utilizes the Google Custom Search Engine. We are using a pay-for plan that is available for the entire university to leverage.</p>

<h3 id="search.northeastern.edu">search.northeastern.edu</h3>

<p>This is a simple use interface to run a global university search. Results are returned directly in this page and no configuration is necessary. This page is built using the same scripts as one that is called from a remote website.</p>
